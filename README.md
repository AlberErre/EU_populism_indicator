# EU_populism_indicator

# Goals:
Develop an EU indicator to visualize the increase/decrease of populism/anti-globalization political parties, since 1990 in the European Union, Norway and Switzerland included and develop further data science/economic indicator to evaluate these trends. 

# Procedure:
1) Python scripting (web scraping) to get elections results data from official EU databases.

2) Create binary attributes regarding the political parties (1 = non-populism, 0 = populism) and summarize the results per country.

3) Analyze data and create indicators to represent the insight obtained. Python: Pandas, Numpy, SciPy libraries. (pdf populism indicators)

4) Develop visual analytic representation to obtain further information using Tableau and Python. (pdf visualization techniques)

5) Clustering methods to obtain further information about patterns/behaviors between EU countries.

# Status:
Finished! - 18 december 2016

Stage 5: Writing down conclusions and summary of results in academic style [two papers obtained (pdf)]

stage 4: Clustering methods (Hierarchical and K-means) to obtain groups of countries that share common patterns/behaviors.

stage 3: Iterations of last three stages (0, 1, 2) to obtain self-valuables-indicators, made from data {Radical Filter, Inestability Filter}

stage 2: Data analysis using Pandas, Numpy and SciPy <- python scripting in process

stage 1: Data cleaning and preprocessing (wrangling) <- python wrangling

stage 0: Obtaining data <- python scripting on web pages

# Deadline: 
18 December 2016 - Completed!
